SMITHOCX Version 1.1  6/15/2014

Added property ShowHistory to turn on and off the
displaying of historical parameter change effects 
on the Smith Chart.  The history is limited to the
last 30 of whatever that parameter changed on the
chart.  Historical changes are shown in dashed lines
while the current parameter effect is shown in a 
solid line.  The history rolls over - so the 31st 
change of a parameter will removed and replace the
1st. This means older circles will disappear as 
new ones are added.

If ShowHistory is "OFF" the data is still collected
and will be displayed if/when ShowHistory is selected 
to be on.

To clear the history first show it, then click the
Redraw.
