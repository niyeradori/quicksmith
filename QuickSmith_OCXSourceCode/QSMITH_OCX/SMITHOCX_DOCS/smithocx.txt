"Smith.OCX" is a 32 bit activeX SmithChart control. It can be very easily incorporated 
in Visual C++ programs. It is a smith chart module capable of plotting reflection
coefficients data series and  VSWR/Q/Gain/Noise/Admittance circles.
It has events that allows data of a point to be displayed by clicking on in with a mouse.
This program was developed to be used as a plugin for RF CAD programs. 
I would be happy to provide the source code and documentation.
I have included a MSword file which explains the properties and events with examples.
An article describing an earlier version was published in February 1997 issue of RF Design.

Thank you.

Sincerely
