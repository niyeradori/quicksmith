QuickSmith is a Smith Chart based linear circuit simulation program for Microsoft Windows. QuickSmith was designed to perform a rapid and efficient Smith Chart calculation. It uses the advantage of Windows environment to provide friendlier way to simulate Graphical RF designs. Latest update 12/11/2014.

Latest binary files: https://quicksmith.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/QSSetup_V501.zip

Install procedure:

1) UnZIP the setup directory to a disk location you own

2) Run SETUP.EXE as administrator by right clicking on itand selecting "run as administrator"

3) Best to accept the default location for installation

4) To start the installation click the icon in the box

5) If an error box regarding MFC40.dll comes up you should click ignore

When the installation is complete you can run the tool except you most likely will not be able to access the help files on WIN 7 and higher. To enable that you need to install a WindowsHelpFiles update. Installing will enable the older style help files, see the Wiki page for more information. CHM style help files are provided and can be unzipped into the application directory. You access these by doublclicking outside of the QuickSmith program, get them from here: https://quicksmith.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/QS_CHMHelp.zip

Acknowledgement:

John Zvonar helped migrate the code to work with 32/64 bit windows operating systems. I almost gave up, when John approached me and offered to help. I would like to thank John for his selfless service and proactive work ethic. There is nothing greater than doing something without any expectation.

QuickSmith migration is not far from perfect but we will keep working at it. Please email us your experience.
